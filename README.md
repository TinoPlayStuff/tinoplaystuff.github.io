I will deal with the LICENSE thing later ... (I need to do some study)

this repo contains two projects:

   - no thing speciall, go to <https://tinoplaystuff.github.io> if you want to 
     read my blog
2. joplin to jekyll post exporter
   - a python script to export all notes in joplin with a specific tag so that 
     one can directly convert ones notes to a blog (jekyll) hosted on githhub
